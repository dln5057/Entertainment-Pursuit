# Entertainment Pursuit

Rutgers Coding Bootcamp
Project 1 - October 1, 2016

Team: the Entertainers

Idea: Find any entertainment nearby with the help of Google maps and ticketmaster.
Once you've found what you've been looking for you can learn more about it, purchase tickets, or add it to favorites.
